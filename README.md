### Project Overview

 The project comprised of the data for **each hour of weather for the year 2012**. 
Basic operations were to be performed inorder to analyze the data stored in a csv file. 


### Learnings from the project

 Whatever I had learnt in the course of **Numpy & Pandas** was used in a very creative manner by simply writing functions for the important operations and calling the functions appropriately to analyze and study the data.

That is what **Data Science** is all about !


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Inputting the data from the **csv** file was an essential step after importing all the important Python libraries to be used in the project.
The easiest way to solve the problem is to first understand what is being asked and what are the functions or operations or commands that can help in performing the task.
Basically, I then used them in creating the functions which were called upon in the latter part of the code.
Using functions is very beneficiary as it allows the user to obtain different results in a very efficient manner.


### Challenges faced

 Understanding the question and finding what command is to be used is the biggest challenge and the more practice one does, easier it would become for them to identify and implement without any mistakes.
It takes time to think what is actually being asked in the question. So, whatever was in the course related to it, I linked that and was able to complete the task.
